# Zoe Relay Documentation

Welcome to the **Zoe Relay** documentation! Zoe Relay is a secure, decentralized messaging infrastructure built with Rust, designed to provide end-to-end encrypted communication with post-quantum security.

## What is Zoe Relay?

Zoe Relay is a messaging relay system that enables secure, private communication between clients using:

- **Post-Quantum Extended Diffie-Hellman (PQXDH)** for key exchange
- **AES encryption** for message content
- **Ephemeral messaging** for enhanced privacy
- **Decentralized architecture** for resilience

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Post-Quantum Security**: Future-proof cryptography using PQXDH
- 🏃‍♂️ **High Performance**: Built in Rust for speed and safety
- 🌐 **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the client side
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Supports multiple client implementations
